Your Excel must exist in ${location}

If the file already exists, delete it before uploading it again.
You don't have to close Excel before uploading. Just save the file, go to the ..FrontPage.ExamplesJac.TestJac.TryOutDatabaseStuff.ExampleLoadDataFromExcelIntoTRACK.FitNesse file list, delete the old one, select the changed file, upload it.
Keep the browser window open. Use another window/tab to run your tests from.
