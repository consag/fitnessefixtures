!define var_filename {tryout.txt}

!3 Create file with 3 rows, the first one the header row
In the following example, the file tryout.txt is created in the subdirectory 'eb2' underneath the 'base' directory.
The 'base' directory is determined by the fileoperation.properties file on Linux.
The subdirectory must already exist.
The option Delimiter= lets you set a delimiter
Default is a semicolon
The option Force=Yes will check if the file already exists and if true, will first remove the file (no questions asked!)
Default is Force=No
