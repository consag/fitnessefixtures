!3 Compare two files
The fixture uses fileoperation.properties to determine which directory contains the files to be compared.

outgoing:/rabo/integration/outgoing
incoming:/rabo/integration/incoming
temp:/rabo/tmp
base:/rabo/testautomation/testdata

base is always a reference to a testdata directory

In the example below, the first directory is specified as |outgoing dwhd|
As "outgoing" is set to /rabo/integration/outgoing, the complete path for the file "test.out" is /rabo/integration/outgoing/dwhd/test.out
The second directory is specified as |base outgoing/dwhd|
As "base" is set to /rabo/testautomation/testdata, the complete path for the file "basetest.out" is /rabo/testautomation/testdata/outgoing/dwhd/basetest.out

Test analysts have write access to /rabo/testautomation/testdata, where they can put the expected output of a file.
Test analysts do not have write access to /rabo/integration/outgoing as this is a directory managed by an application.
