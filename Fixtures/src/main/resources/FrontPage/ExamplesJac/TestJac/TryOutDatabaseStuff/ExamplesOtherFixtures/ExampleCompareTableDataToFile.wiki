!2 Compare table to file using default method
The following example compares table records to a file. The records are filtered out of the table FIXTURETEST using a filter on CUST_CITY and CUST_ID.
The fixture will create a temporary file for the table data, using the provided delimiter (semicolon in the example below)
The result of 'Same Data?' is 'No', because the fixture issues a SQL statement with an ORDER BY the provided 'unique identifier', CUST_ID.

!2 Compare table to file using provided SQL
In this example the same source table and target file are used. This time however, a specific SQL is used. This SQL filters and sorts the data. The ORDER BY uses a DESCending clause. This way, the data as retrieved by the SQL is in the same order as the data in the file.
As a result, the comparison does not result in any differences.
