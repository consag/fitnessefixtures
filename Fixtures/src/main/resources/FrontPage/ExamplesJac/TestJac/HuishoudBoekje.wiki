!3 Original Call as Huishoudboekje uses it
|do workflows                                                       |
|type of workflow|folder|workflow name        |workflow successfull?|
|HHB              |HHB   |wf_HHB_CLEANUP_TABLES|Success              |

!3 Extensions - ask for error msg (if any)
|do workflows                                                       |
|type of workflow|folder|workflow name        |workflow successfull?|error?|
|HHB              |HHB   |wf_HHB_CLEANUP_TABLES|Success              |No errors encountered.|

!3 Extension - could also ask for number of source or target records. Does not have to be in this order.
|do workflows                                                       |
|type of workflow|folder|workflow name        |workflow successfull?|error?|source rows?|target rows?|
|HHB              |HHB   |wf_HHB_CLEANUP_TABLES|Success              |No errors encountered.|1|1|

!3 Another example: retrieve number of source records and target records. Not interested in error msg in this example.
|do workflows                                                       |
|type of workflow|folder|workflow name        |workflow successfull?|target rows?|source rows?|
|HHB              |HHB   |wf_HHB_CLEANUP_TABLES|Success              |1|1|
