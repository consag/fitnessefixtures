!1 Example how to start a workflow with various options
----


!3 Basic call
|start workflow|basic_call_wf                                        |
|application |folder  |workflow name          |workflow successful?|
|EB2         |SIL_Vert|SIL_UpdateRowInRunTable|Success             |

!3 Basic call - 
* Abort test page if the workflow or test fails
* Verify the target rows
* Verify the source rows
Note: Verifying source and target rows only works if there is only 1 session in a workflow and that session has the same name as the workflow. This is true for Oracle BI Application workflows, but not for most others.
This is a known limitation of the fixture. Let me know, if you need this function to be available for other cases.
|start workflow|wf_call_with_abort_and_rowcounts                                                              |
|application |folder  |workflow name          |abort on error|workflow successful?|target rows?|source rows?|
|EB2         |SIL_Vert|SIL_UpdateRowInRunTable|Yes           |Success             |1           |1           |


!3 Extension - check error msg (if any)
|start workflow|wf_call_with_error_retrieval                                                |
|application |folder  |workflow name          |workflow successful?|error?                |
|EB2         |SIL_Vert|SIL_UpdateRowInRunTable|Success             |No errors encountered.|

!3 Extension - could also ask for number of source or target records. Does not have to be in this order.
|start workflow|wf_call_with_error_retrieval_and_rowcounts                                                            |
|application |folder  |workflow name          |workflow successful?|error?                |source rows?|target rows?|
|EB2         |SIL_Vert|SIL_UpdateRowInRunTable|Success             |No errors encountered.|1           |1           |

!3 example with parameter file: retrieve number of source records and target records.
|start workflow|wf_call_with_paramfile                                                                                                                                  |
|application |folder  |workflow name          |parameter directory|parameter file|workflow successful?|error?               |target success rows?|source success rows?|
|EB2         |SIL_Vert|SIL_UpdateRowInRunTable|base eb2           |param.txt     |Success             |No errors encountered|1                   |1                   |
