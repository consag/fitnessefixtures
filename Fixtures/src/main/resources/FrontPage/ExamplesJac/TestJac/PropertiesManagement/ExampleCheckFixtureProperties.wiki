!3 Fixture example: Check fixture properties
Use this fixture to verify the connection the fixtures make to databases.

You can use 'show' to just display the entry (if found).
If you expect a specific value, use the word 'ensure' and specify the value you expect. The fixture will display an error if the value in the database.properties file is different.
As 'ensure' will not show you the actual value, you may still want to use the word 'show' to have the fixture show you what's in the properties file.
