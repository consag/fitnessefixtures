# fitnessefixtures
The FitNesse Fixtures are created as part of an overall solution for automating the test cycle.

## Linux installation ReadMe
The readme for Linux can be found in the directory 'linuxscripts', here on github: https://github.com/consag/fitnessefixtures/tree/master/linuxscripts


## Download
You can download the jar with all compiled fixtures from the release tab.

## Fixture documentation
Check the properties files, [Properties files on gist](https://gist.github.com/jacbeekers), here on github with examples for the fixture.properties, application.properties and other important properties files.

## FitNesse Configuration
Fixtures rely on various parameters that need to be set up in properties files. Not all fixtures use all properties files.
Check our [wiki](https://github.com/consag/fitnessefixtures/wiki/Fixture-configuration) for more information.

## Fixtures - Properties file examples
If you're wondering what you need to put in the properties files, check out our [examples on GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Ajacbeekers+properties&ref=searchresults).

Examples can also be found in config folder in this repository.
Some scripts, like encrypt_for_fitnesse.sh, also use these properties files.

## Password encryption
Password encryption is enabled for connection.properties (used by database fixtures) and security.properties (used only if you enable HTTPS). 
Use the encrypt_for_fitnesse.sh script (adjust it for Windows) to encrypt passwords.
Note: encrypt_for_fitnesse.sh requires the file config/siteKey. This file must contain one line only and will be used as random seed for the encryption of passwords.
