## Linux installation ReadMe
The readme for Linux can be found in the directory 'linuxscripts', here on github: https://github.com/consag/fitnessefixtures/tree/master/linuxscripts

## Fixture documentation
Check the properties files, [Properties files on gist](https://gist.github.com/jacbeekers), here on github with examples for the fixture.properties, application.properties and other important properties files.

## FitNesse Configuration
Fixtures rely on various parameters that need to be set up in properties files. Not all fixtures use all properties files.
Check our [wiki](https://github.com/consag/fitnessefixtures/wiki/Fixture-configuration) for more information.
